# Business Data Generation Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python to generate synthetic business data for various categories including patient information, order details, payment methods, shipping details, medical product information, and customer support records. The data is generated using the `Faker` library and is organized into a structured format suitable for analysis and storage.

## Features

- **Patient Information Generation**: Simulates patient data including name, age, gender, medical history, allergies, and prescriptions.
- **Order Details Generation**: Creates synthetic order details with unique order numbers, dates, times, items, quantities, prices, and total amounts.
- **Payment Methods Generation**: Generates realistic payment information, including credit card numbers and billing addresses.
- **Shipping Details Generation**: Simulates shipping details such as names, addresses, cities, states, ZIP codes, and shipping methods.
- **Medical Product Information**: Generates random product information including names, descriptions, categories, brands, prices, availability, and reviews.
- **Customer Support Records**: Simulates customer support data including ticket numbers, customer names, issues, support agents, and resolution statuses.
- **Data Storage**: Organizes the generated data into a Pandas DataFrame and saves it to a Parquet file for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-data-generation.git
    cd business-data-generation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install additional dependencies if needed**:
    ```bash
    pip install faker pandas pyarrow
    ```

## Usage

To generate the synthetic data and save it to a Parquet file, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Python script**:
    ```bash
    python generate_data.py
    ```

2. **Load the generated data**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_parquet('business_data.parquet')
    ```

3. **Explore the data**:
    ```python
    print(df.head())
    print(df.info())
    ```
